## 1. Problem Statement

Modern knowledge workers, students, and small teams need a lightweight, desktop-based task management tool that is simple to install, offline-capable, and safe with local data storage. This project implements a JavaFX desktop application for personal task and to-do management with a small relational database backend using Hibernate (JPA). Key functional requirements:

- Create, edit, and delete tasks with title, description, priority, deadline, and completion state.
- User accounts and authentication (email + password).
- User preferences for UI and behavioral choices.
- Task listing and filters (by priority, completion state, deadline sorting).
- Local persistence with transactional guarantees and safe schema management.

Non-functional requirements:

- Cross-platform Java desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Simple install (JAR + bundled JRE or run via Maven during development)
- Clean, modern UI implemented with JavaFX and CSS
- Maintainable codebase with separation of concerns (presentation, service, persistence)

Challenges addressed:

- Mapping Java 8+ time types (LocalDate, LocalDateTime) to Oracle TIMESTAMP/DATE types
- Ensuring database schema stability in multi-environment deployments (dev vs production)
- Balancing convenience (hibernate auto DDL) and safety (manual DDL for production)


## 2. ER Diagram

The ER diagram for the application is included in `docs/images/er_diagram.svg` and summarized below:

- User (1) — (N) Task
- User (1) — (N) UserPreference

Attributes (selected):
- User: id (PK), email (unique), password, display_name, created_at, last_login
- Task: id (PK), title, description, priority, deadline, completed, created_at, updated_at, user_id (FK)
- UserPreference: id (PK), preference_key, preference_value, created_at, user_id (FK)

## Executive summary

This Task Management & To‑Do desktop application is a lightweight JavaFX application designed for personal productivity. It provides user accounts, task management (CRUD), persistent storage via Hibernate (JPA), and a clean, modern UI. The system is intentionally small but extensible: it demonstrates layered architecture, transaction-safe persistence, and attention to production-ready concerns such as manual DB schema control and secure configuration.

This report documents the problem and solution, provides a complete ER diagram, full DDL, normalization analysis, system requirements, architecture, module descriptions, code snippets, testing plan, and deployment instructions. Appendices contain the full entity source code and helper scripts.


## 1. Problem Statement (detailed)

Background: Personal information management (PIM) remains a core productivity problem. Large SaaS products (Asana, Trello) offer collaboration but can be heavy and require internet connectivity. Many users want an offline, local-first tool for tasks and reminders with a minimal footprint and easy installation.

Goals:

- Provide a single-user-first desktop app with optional multi-user capability via local database accounts.
- Offer common task operations quickly: add, edit, remove, mark complete, set priority and deadlines.
- Keep the application portable and easy to build from source for academic evaluation.

Success criteria:

- Functional parity with typical personal task apps: create and manage tasks reliably.
- Schema stability: ability to run in production without unexpected schema changes.
- Code quality: modular design, clear separation of layers, and documented components.


## 2. ER Diagram (expanded)

The ER model captures three core entities: User, Task, and UserPreference. Relationships:

- User 1 — N Task: each task belongs to a user.
- User 1 — N UserPreference: each user can have multiple key/value preferences.

The ER diagram file is attached at `docs/images/er_diagram.svg`. Below is a textual mapping of attributes and constraints:

- User(id PK, email UNIQUE NOT NULL, password NOT NULL, display_name, created_at TIMESTAMP, last_login TIMESTAMP)
- Task(id PK, title NOT NULL, description, priority, deadline DATE, completed NUMBER(1) DEFAULT 0, created_at TIMESTAMP, updated_at TIMESTAMP, user_id FK -> User(id))
- UserPreference(id PK, preference_key NOT NULL, preference_value, created_at TIMESTAMP, user_id FK -> User(id))


## 3. Database Schema (complete DDL)

The project includes a full Oracle-compatible DDL script: `src/main/resources/sql/create_schema_oracle.sql`.

For convenience, the script is reproduced here verbatim (Appendix A also references the file in the repo):

```
-- Schema and objects for Task Management app (Oracle)
-- Run as a DBA (SYSTEM) or a user with CREATE USER and GRANT privileges.

-- 1) Create an application schema/user (recommended)
-- Run as SYS or SYSTEM:
-- CREATE USER task_app IDENTIFIED BY "ChangeMeStrongPwd1";
-- GRANT CREATE SESSION TO task_app;
-- GRANT CREATE TABLE TO task_app;
-- GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE TO task_app;
-- GRANT CREATE VIEW TO task_app;
-- GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO task_app;
-- GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO task_app; -- optional, or grant specific quotas

-- Alternatively, if you want to create objects in an existing schema, skip user creation

-- 2) Connect as the application user (or run the following as that user)
-- CONNECT task_app/ChangeMeStrongPwd1@<db_connect_string>

-- 3) Create sequences used by JPA annotations
CREATE SEQUENCE TASK_SEQ START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;
CREATE SEQUENCE USER_SEQ START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;
CREATE SEQUENCE PREFERENCE_SEQ START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;

-- 4) Create tables

-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
    display_name VARCHAR2(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);

-- Unique constraint on email
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT uq_users_email UNIQUE (email);

-- Tasks table
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR2(400) NOT NULL,
    description CLOB,
    priority VARCHAR2(50),
    deadline DATE,
    completed NUMBER(1) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    user_id NUMBER(10) NOT NULL
);

-- Foreign key to users
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT fk_tasks_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Index for tasks.user_id
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_user_id ON tasks(user_id);

-- User preferences table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    id NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    preference_key VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
    preference_value VARCHAR2(2000),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    user_id NUMBER(10) NOT NULL
);

-- Foreign key to users
ALTER TABLE user_preferences ADD CONSTRAINT fk_prefs_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Index for preferences.user_id
CREATE INDEX idx_prefs_user_id ON user_preferences(user_id);

-- 5) Optional: triggers to set id from sequence if inserts originate outside Hibernate
-- (Hibernate normally fetches NEXTVAL itself; triggers are optional.)

-- Trigger for tasks
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_tasks_before_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON tasks
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF :NEW.id IS NULL THEN
    SELECT TASK_SEQ.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.id FROM DUAL;
  END IF;
END;
/

-- Trigger for users
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_users_before_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF :NEW.id IS NULL THEN
    SELECT USER_SEQ.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.id FROM DUAL;
  END IF;
END;
/

-- Trigger for user_preferences
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_prefs_before_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON user_preferences
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF :NEW.id IS NULL THEN
    SELECT PREFERENCE_SEQ.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.id FROM DUAL;
  END IF;
END;
/
-- 6) Optional: enforce boolean semantics for 'completed' column (0/1) via check constraint
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT chk_tasks_completed CHECK (completed IN (0,1));

-- 7) Verification queries (run as the application user)
-- List tables
-- SELECT table_name FROM user_tables WHERE table_name IN ('USERS','TASKS','USER_PREFERENCES');

-- Check sequences
-- SELECT sequence_name, last_number FROM user_sequences WHERE sequence_name IN ('TASK_SEQ','USER_SEQ','PREFERENCE_SEQ');

-- Basic sample inserts to test sequences and FK constraints
-- INSERT INTO users(email, password, display_name, created_at) VALUES ('alice@example.com', 'secret', 'Alice', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
-- INSERT INTO tasks(title, description, priority, deadline, completed, created_at, user_id) VALUES ('Test task', 'desc', 'High', TO_DATE('2025-12-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 0, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 1);

-- End of script
```


## 4. Database Normalization (detailed analysis and examples)

Normalization rationale:

- The `users` table contains atomic attributes such as email and password; email is declared UNIQUE to prevent duplicates.
- The `tasks` table uses `user_id` as a foreign key; all task attributes are functionally dependent on the primary key `id` (1NF and 2NF satisfied).
- `user_preferences` stores key-value pairs to avoid schema changes when adding new preference items, improving extensibility.

Example demonstrating avoidance of redundancy:

- If preferences were stored as columns in `users` (e.g., `pref_theme`, `pref_notifications`), adding new preference types would require ALTER TABLE statements and potential data migration. The key/value approach isolates preferences and keeps the main `users` table lean.

Normalization trade-offs:

- The key/value model is flexible but can make queries for multiple preferences slightly more complex (joins or aggregation). For our app scale, the simplicity and flexibility outweigh this cost.


## 5. System Requirements (expanded)

Recommended development environment:

- Java 17 (LTS) for modern features and long-term support.
- Maven 3.8+, IntelliJ IDEA Community/Ultimate edition, or Visual Studio Code with the Java extension pack.
- Oracle XE for local testing; alternatively use Postgres for easier CI integration.

Production considerations:

- For single-user desktop installs, an embedded database (H2 with file storage) is acceptable. For multi-user or multi-machine deployments, use a managed RDBMS and create a secure dedicated schema.


## 6. System Design (expanded)

Component details:

- MainApp (application entry): initializes `ConfigManager`, sets up the `SceneRouter`, and launches JavaFX.
- SceneRouter: centralizes scene switching and sharing the current user session across controllers.
- DatabaseService: single point of contact for all database operations; uses Hibernate sessions and transactions.
- HibernateUtil: lazily builds a singleton `SessionFactory` using `hibernate.cfg.xml` and ensures clean shutdown.

Threading and UI responsiveness:

- Database operations are executed on background threads to avoid blocking the JavaFX Application Thread. Use `Task`/`Service` from JavaFX concurrency utilities when performing long-running queries.


## 7. Core Modules (detailed responsibilities)

- Authentication module: secure password storage is recommended (hashed + salted using BCrypt). Currently the project stores raw passwords — improve by integrating BCrypt (BCrypt library) for production.
- Task management module: provides filtering by priority/completion and ordering by deadline/created date.
- Preferences module: persists user settings; used at startup to apply UI theme and default sort order.


## 8. Code Snippets (extended)

Full entity sources are in Appendix D. Additional notable snippets:

- HibernateUtil (simplified):

```java
public class HibernateUtil {
    private static SessionFactory sessionFactory;
    public static synchronized SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
        if (sessionFactory == null) {
            Configuration cfg = new Configuration().configure();
            StandardServiceRegistryBuilder builder = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder()
                .applySettings(cfg.getProperties());
            sessionFactory = cfg.buildSessionFactory(builder.build());
        }
        return sessionFactory;
    }
}
```

- DatabaseService: sample query for tasks by priority:

```java
public List<Task> getUserTasksByPriority(int userId, String priority) {
    try (Session s = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession()) {
        return s.createQuery("from Task t where t.user.id = :uid and t.priority = :p", Task.class)
                .setParameter("uid", userId)
                .setParameter("p", priority)
                .list();
    }
}
```


## 9. Testing Plan and Sample Test Cases

Testing strategy:

- Unit tests: isolate service-layer logic (mock SessionFactory or use an in-memory DB such as H2 with a Hibernate config profile).
- Integration tests: spin up a transient Oracle/Postgres instance (Docker) and run migrations or manually provision schema before tests.
- Manual acceptance tests: run the application, register user, create tasks, edit tasks, delete tasks; verify referential integrity.

Sample test cases (manual):

1) Register and login
- Steps: Open app -> Register with email/password -> Login
- Expected: user created in `users` table; login succeeds; dashboard loads with empty task list.

2) Create task and mark complete
- Steps: Add task with title/description/priority/deadline -> Verify in UI and DB -> Mark complete
- Expected: `tasks.completed` toggles from 0 to 1; `updated_at` changes.

3) Cascade delete
- Steps: Create user with tasks -> Delete user via DB -> Expected: tasks deleted by ON DELETE CASCADE constraint.


## 10. Packaging, Deployment and GitHub Submission

Packaging:

- Build a runnable JAR with dependencies using Maven Shade plugin or use a bundled runtime with jlink for smaller size.
- Include the SQL script and report in the repository under `docs/`.

Deployment instructions (developer mode):

```powershell
mvn clean package -DskipTests
mvn javafx:run
```

GitHub submission checklist:

- Create GitHub repo and push `main` branch.
- Verify `.gitignore` excludes `application.properties` that may contain credentials.
- Trigger CI (if configured) to convert SVG diagrams to PNG and produce artifact files.

## Appendices (detailed)

### Appendix A — Full DDL Script

See `src/main/resources/sql/create_schema_oracle.sql` in the repository.

### Appendix B — Hibernate Config Recommendation and XML diff

Current snippet in `src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml`:

```xml
<property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>
```

Recommended change to validate-only mode:

```xml
<property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">validate</property>
```

Use `validate` in production to ensure the schema matches the mappings without making changes. Remove the property entirely to fully disable any checks.


### Appendix C — How to convert this Markdown to .docx (detailed)

1) Install Pandoc: https://pandoc.org/installing.html (Windows: use Chocolatey `choco install pandoc -y`).
2) Run the helper PowerShell script provided in `docs/report/convert_to_docx.ps1`.

Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\user\IdeaProjects\Task Management and To-Do Application
docs\report\convert_to_docx.ps1 -Input "..\PROJECT_REPORT_DETAILED.md" -Output "PROJECT_REPORT_DETAILED.docx"
```


### Appendix D — Full entity sources (abridged)

The main entity classes are in `src/main/java/com/taskmanager/entity/`.

Task.java (abridged):

```java
package com.taskmanager.entity;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Entity
@Table(name = "tasks")
public class Task {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "task_seq")
    @SequenceGenerator(name = "task_seq", sequenceName = "TASK_SEQ", allocationSize = 1)
    private int id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String title;

    private String description;

    private String priority;

    private LocalDate deadline;

    private boolean completed;

    @Column(name = "created_at")
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;

    @Column(name = "updated_at")
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id", nullable = false)
    private User user;

    // constructors, getters, setters, @PreUpdate omitted for brevity
}
```

User.java and UserPreference.java are included in the codebase; the full files are included in the repository and this appendix references them by path.


### Appendix E — Security & Hardening Notes

- Don't keep DB admin credentials (`system`) in `hibernate.cfg.xml`. Create a dedicated schema and store production credentials in environment variables or an encrypted config.
- Use BCrypt to store password hashes rather than plaintext passwords.
- Limit physical access to the database files and restrict network access (bind to localhost for single-user installs).


### Appendix F — Grading Rubric (if needed for academic submission)

- Problem analysis & requirements: 20%
- Design & architecture: 20%
- Implementation & code quality: 30%
- Documentation, report, and diagrams: 20%
- Tests and verification: 10%
